# Tic-Tac-Toe
Python Implementation of Tic Tac Toe Game.
In this classic game of Tic Tac Toe, we have used simple programming techniques such as the 
use of dictionaries, functions, methods, conditional statements etc. Switching between 2 users 
so that they can input their moves in the spaces in turns. Checking all the possible conditions to 
be met to decide the winner. Error analysis in case of a wrong input and continuity of the 
process. Ending the game as a draw if there is no winner after a total of nine moves when all 
the positions are filled.
